## Overview
The "Tuple Out" Dice Game is a Python-based dice game where players take turns rolling dice to score points. 
The objective is to score the most points or be the first player to reach a target score. 
The game introduces strategic decisions: players can reroll unfixed dice to improve their score but risk "tupling out" (rolling three identical numbers), 
which results in scoring zero for that turn.

## Features
- **Two-player mode:** Players alternate turns until one reaches the target score.
- **Dynamic gameplay:** Players can choose to reroll unfixed dice or stop to secure their current points.
- **Interactive user experience:** Simple prompts guide players through their decisions.
- **Scoring system:** Tracks and displays scores after each turn, declaring the winner at the end.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure that Python is installed on your computer.
  To verify, run `python -v` and ensure a valid version is running
